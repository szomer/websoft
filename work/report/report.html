<h2>S01</h2>
<p>The first time I found out about git and github was probably around 3 or 4 years ago. Often times when searching online for written code or usefull tools I ended up on github. However back then I did not understand it's purpose or the difference between git or github. That was until last year, when one of the courses introduced us to git. We started working on projects where git became the most usefull tool for sharing and communicating between the teammembers. </p>
<p>I have worked with HTML and CSS before. This was back when I was still in highschool, where we had to create our own website and work with styling. I remember spending a lot of extra time on the website and it ended up being one of my favorite assignments of those classes. However I have only worked with the presentation of creating a web application, not the behind the scenes like javascript, networking and connecting it to a databse.</p>
<p>I learned that git is also used for web applications. Before I only saw git being used with intellij.</p>

<p>I have worked with HTML and CSS before. From my understanding, HTML is used to create the elements of the webside shown to the user and create a structure. For example all the pictures, text, title, divisions and so on. CSS is used to style all of those elements. For example to change the color, size, space of these elements. I have not worked with javascript before however I believe I understand it's purpose. Javascript is the code running behind the scenes and is not visible for the user to see. For example if a website uses specific animations, calculations, processes information and so on.</p>
<p>What happens when a computer enters the website "http://website.com/index.html" into the browser? First of all, the user will be making use of the HyperText Tranfer Protocol. This protocol is used to connect the browser to a webserver. With a HTTP resonse from the server we receive the html document and are able to view the website.</p>
<p>It has been multiple years since I worked with html again and I started remembering the keywoards and the use of HTML, CSS adn Javascript again.</p>
